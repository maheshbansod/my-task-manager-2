# My Task Manager 2

This task manager seperates tasks in four different categories: A, B, C and D.  
### Description of the categories
## A: Urgent and Important tasks
These tasks are those that have a deadline close and are important to your life. They maybe those tasks that were neglected before but have become urgent now. (think global warming)
## B: Important but not urgent tasks
B tasks are the ones that you should work upon the most. They may become A tasks if neglected. These tasks help you attain your goals but are not urgent.
## C: Not important but urgent
Tasks in this category are those that have deadline close but are unimportant to your life. You may consider whether you can completely avoid doing these tasks by delegating them to someone else.
## D: Not important and not urgent
These tasks are those that contiribute nothing to achieving your goals. Doing these tasks is apparently useless. These may include those tasks that give you comfort. **These tasks must be done to avoid overworking and stressing yourself out but it's necessary to only do them in moderation and do them rarely**
